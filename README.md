# react-chat-kit
A UI Kit for building chat interfaces in React, inspired by the WhatsApp experience.  
The goal is to provide simple components with a cleaner design, closer to a familiar and consolidated interface, while also serving as a study resource.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-chat-kit
# or
yarn add react-chat-kit
```
## Usage
Before using any component, import the default style tokens:

```jsx
import 'react-chat-kit/styles/tokens.css';
```
